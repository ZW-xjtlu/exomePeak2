Changes in version 0.99.9 (2020-03-10)
+ Fix comments proposed in the bioconductor submission issue on Github

Changes in version 1.3.3 (2021-02-03)
+ When extract bins on transcripts, the exons transcripts are merged into one gene unit, and all of the overlapping exons on the gene unit will be merged. Before 1.3.2 the overlapping exons on the same transcript are not merged. 

+ Bins are generated for the genes having transcripts on different stands and chromosomes, and before 1.3.2 those multi-positional genes are filtered out from analysis; the transcripts on different strands will be now divided into multiple gene units with their IDs concatenated by "_+/-_seqnames" at the ends.
