Description: exomePeak2 provides bias-aware quantification and peak detection for Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing data (MeRIP-Seq). MeRIP-Seq is a commonly applied sequencing technology that can measure the location and abundance of RNA modification sites under given cell line conditions. However, quantification and peak calling in MeRIP-Seq are sensitive to PCR amplification biases, which generally present in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. In addition, the count data generated by RNA-Seq exhibits significant biological variations between biological replicates. exomePeak2 collectively address the challenges by introducing a series of robust data science tools tailored for MeRIP-Seq. Using exomePeak2, users can perform peak calling, modification site quantification and differential analysis through a straightforward single-step function. Alternatively, multi-step functions can be used to generate diagnostic plots and perform customized analyses.
