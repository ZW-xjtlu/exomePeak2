\title{Statistical Inference with DESeq package based on the provided reads count for exomic bins.}
\usage{
call_peaks_with_GLM(SE_bins, glm_type = c("Poisson", "NB", "DESeq2"),
  correct_GC_bg = FALSE, qtnorm = TRUE, txdb, count_cutoff = 5,
  p_cutoff = NULL, p_adj_cutoff = 0.05, logFC_cutoff = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{SE_bins}{a \code{SummarizedExperiment} object. The meta-data collumn should contain the design information of IP/input + treated/control.}

\item{glm_type}{a character, which can be one of  the "Poisson", "NB", and "DESeq2". This argument specify the type of generalized linear model used in peak calling; Default to be "Poisson".
The DESeq2 method is only recommended for high power experiments with more than 3 biological replicates for both IP and input.}

\item{correct_GC_bg}{a \code{logical} value of whether to estimate the GC content linear effect on background regions; default \code{= FALSE}.

If \code{correct_GC_bg = TRUE}, it may result in a more accurate estimation of the technical effect of GC content for the RNA modifications that are highly biologically related to GC content.}

\item{qtnorm}{a \code{logical} of whether to perform subset quantile normalization after the GC content linear effect correctionï¼› default \code{= TRUE}.

Subset quantile normalization will be applied within the IP and input samples seperately to account for the inherent differences between the marginal distributions of IP and input samples.}

\item{txdb}{the txdb object that is necessary for the calculation of the merge of the peaks.}

\item{count_cutoff}{an integer value indicating the cutoff of the mean of reads count in a row, inference is only performed on the windows with the row average read count bigger than the cutoff. Default value is 5.}

\item{p_cutoff}{a numeric value of the p value cutoff used in DESeq inference.}

\item{p_adj_cutoff}{a numeric value of the adjusted p value cutoff used in DESeq2 inference; if provided, the value of \code{p_cutoff} will be ignored; Default = 0.05.}

\item{logFC_cutoff}{a non negative numeric value of the log2 fold change (log2 IP/input) cutoff used in the inferene of peaks.}
}
\value{
This function will return a list of \code{GRangesList} object storing peaks for both modification and control.
}
\description{
\code{call_peaks_with_GLM} conduct inference on every exome bins using negative binomial model,
the significant bins will be the merged into peaks.
}
\details{
\code{call_peaks_with_GLM} will performe exome level peak calling using DESeq2 model,

The significant bins will be merged into modification peaks.

The insignificant bins (pass the row means filtering) will also be merged into control peaks.
